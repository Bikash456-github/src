 * 
 * requirement changes in spiral model are not allowed in between cycle 
 * in waterfall model requrement changes are not allowed
 * 7 stage of life cycle 
 * 
 * 1 requirement collection 
 * 2 fesibility testing
 * 3 design                     //architech

 * waterfall model 
 * spiral model    Iterative and Incremental Model 
 * v and v  model 
 * agile model
 * prototype model
 * 
 * Advantage of spiral model 
 * requrement changes are not  allowed
 * costumer will be able to see the application at early stage itself 
 * just because costumer is able to receive the application at early stage costumer can come up with
 * lot of ides to changes
 * 
 * DISADAVTAGES OF spiral model
 * requrement changes are not allowed in between cycle 
 * requirement collection phase and design phase not tested
 * every cycle of spiral model looks like waterfall model 
 * 
 * ADVANTAGE of v and v model 
 * v and v requrement can be change waterfall and spiral model we cannot change the requrement 
 * v model design tested, coding tested and 
 * step of v and v model costumer requrement software requrement specification 
 * high level design low leel design coding
